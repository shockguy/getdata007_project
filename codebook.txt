For the most part the data columns use the names from the original codebook.  These could be more clearly "descriptive", but there was a desire to conform to the original names so for the sake of consistency so downstream others could work backwards to the origin of the data if necessary. Note that the data is in a directory called "dataset", which should reside in the script working directory.  I chose to "dataset" because the directory the zip created for the data was too messy for my tastes.
